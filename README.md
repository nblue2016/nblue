## Introduction
nblue-core is core module for nblue framework, it includes more useful class and module. The full package was written by ES6, so it'd better run more than node v6.7.

## Installation:
You can use npm to install nblue
```
npm install nblue-core
```

Run test cases with mocha
```
npm install mocha
npm test
```

## Usage

### aq
**aq** is a static class, it can package a value or function to return a ES6 Promise. You can see following example to learn main usage about it, for more details, please see the [document](https://github.com/nblue2016/nblue/blob/master/doc/aq.md) by link

``` javascript
const nblue = require('nblue-core')
const aq = nblue.aq

// promise a value
aq.
  then('test').
  then((data) => {
    console.log(data) // data is test
  })

// it equal following statement
Promise.resolve('test')

// read an file
const path = require('path')
const file = path.join(__dirname, 'test.dat')

aq.
  readFile(file, { encoding: 'utf-8' }).
  then((data) => {
    console.log(data) // output file content
  })

// invoke rest method
aq.
  rest("http://127.0.0.1:8080/?key1=val1&key2=val2").
  then((data) => {
    console.log(data) // output the response body by web api
  }).
  catch((err) => {
    console.log(err) // output error message
  })

```

### betch
**betch** is mostly feature of nblue, it can be easy to apply list of promises one by one or merge their result by array. Also, the betch can apply a predefined script with arguments. betch was created base on co, but it add more complex features, for more details you can read  [this document](https://github.com/nblue2016/nblue/blob/master/doc/betch.md)

betch an object will apply Promises one by one and returns the latest result
``` javascript
const nblue = require('nblue-core')
const betch = nblue.betch

// use an object to execute promises one by one
betch({
  r1: Promise.resolve(1),
  r2: (ctx, data) => Promise.resolve(data + 2),
  r3: (ctx, data) => data + 3
}).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be 6
})
```

We get the full result for every key with $fullReturn argument

``` javascript
// use an object to execute promises one by one
betch({
  r1: Promise.resolve(1),
  r2: (ctx, data) => Promise.resolve(data + 2),
  r3: (ctx, data) => data + 3
}, { $fullReturn: true}).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be { r1:1, r2:3, r3:6 }
})
```

``` javascript
// or use array to execute promises with parallel mode
betch([
  Promise.resolve(1),
  Promise.resolve(2),
  Promise.resolve(3)
]).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be [1, 2, 3]
})
```

use betch$ to run script
``` javascript
// define script file in folder
script({
  r1: 1,
  r2: Promise.resolve(2),
  r3: (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.$args && ctx.$args.a1) {
      return ctx.$args.a1
    }

    return 5
  }
})

// or use array to execute promises with parallel mode
betch(`${__dirname}//script.js`).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be 5
})

// using argument in options
betch(`${__dirname}//script.js`, { a1: 20 }).
then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // data should be 20
})
```
